'''This file contains main code for homework 2, which simulates a bike race.
Please name this file "homework2.py" then upload it to gradescope.
We will implement the classes:  velocipede.
                                  bike (inherits from velocipede).
                                rider
                                  user_rider (inherits from rider. You write this.)
                                  optimized_rider (inherits from rider. You write this.)
                                track
                                race
Then we simulate a bike race!

By default, riders will always switch gears up and pedal 5 times.
Your part of the code will be to implement a game where a user can race against the computer.
Then you will write the class optimized_rider that overwrites the gear_switch_policy and pedal_policy.
The optimized_rider should win the race against the unoptimized riders.

    This means that if we need to change our function to switch gears,

'''
Instructions:
Implement a class called user_rider that asks the user for input to determine the number of times to pedal and how to shift gears.
Play around to find a strategy that causes Mario and Wario to win when the other riders stick to the default strategy.
Then, implement a class called optimized_rider that overwrites the rider class and implements your strategy programmatically.
You may not change the parameters of the riders or their velocipedes. You can only chang the pedal policy or gear shift policy.
You may use a different strategy for Mario than for Wario, though I didn't find this necessary.
You may add more attributes to your optimized_rider class to help plan their strategy. I found it useful to store the previous pedal amount and previous energy breakdown.
You may add more print statements to get more information about what strategies work.
I found it helpful to use the super() keyword, which refers to the parent class.
